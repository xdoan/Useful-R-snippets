# Useful-R-snippets
R functions and commands I want to reuse and keep track of. 

# Functions.R
1) ggplot2 bargraph ordered by chromosome with the UCSC "chr1...chrY" naming system. Not alphanumeric ordering. Could probably use mixedsort() but this allows me to control the order of things (like if I wanted genome first, instead of last). 
2) paired bargraph of function #1 for paired samples, e.g. Tumor/Normal, treatment/no-treatment.
